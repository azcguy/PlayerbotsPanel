### EARLY ALPHA - DOESNT WORK AND DONT REPORT BUGS
![image](/textures/screenshot-1.png)

This addon is for use with https://github.com/liyunfan1223/mod-playerbots 

The goal of this addon is to provide a convenient interface to manage player owned Playerbots.
For now the addon solely focuses on your bots, ignoring RandomBot, with preference given to your alt-bots.
Strong focus is to make the design and functionality feel native to the game, as if made by Blizzard.
Another focus is UX design, quick access, good overview and clarity.
This addon will be most valued if you are an altocholic who likes to level and manage bots.

Currently the addon is in very early alpha, this repo is for developers to test addon/server communication.
You are free to check the addon, but any bug reports will be ignored and closed until first stable version.
You are free to make suggestions, but read the planned features first.

## INSTRUCTIONS
Clone the repository into your AddOns folder
Open Settings tab, and use "Register" buttons to add owned bots.
Hover over various help (?) and other buttons to see what they do.

## PLANNED FEATURES
Big ones:
[] Contextual minipanel
[] Group Loot control minipanel
[] Raid mode (list expands)
[] Party / Raid templates
